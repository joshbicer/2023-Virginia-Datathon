# 2023 Virginia Datathon

Hundreds of students and professionals participated in the Virginia Office of Data Governance and Analytics (ODGA) Datathon competition hosted at the Library of Virginia in Richmond, VA. This year's theme was to focus on the causes, insights, and solutions around the health issue of maternal mortality in the commonwealth. My group featured five students in the online Master's of Business Analytics (MSBA) at William and Mary and we were awarded first place for our presentation on Mitigating Maternal Mortality.
